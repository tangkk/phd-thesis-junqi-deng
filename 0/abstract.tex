This thesis presents two novel ways of solving the large vocabulary (LV) automatic chord estimation (ACE) problem with deep learning technologies, and tries to apply these solutions within an automatic jazz improvisation context. Being well aware of the annotation subjectivity issue, this thesis attests the necessity of LV with a joint argument of machine musicianship and the Turing test. Built upon this premise, it proposes two system frameworks that lead to practical LVACE solutions.

The first framework considers the separation of segmentation and classification, unlike all previous studies that combine the two in one single pass. Three deep learning models are proposed for classification. Under LV evaluation, two of them over-fit chords with large populations, while the third model shows great potential in balanced performance. %The model has proved its successfulness in the music information retrieval evaluation exchange 2016 ACE tasks.

The second framework considers an end-to-end neural network approach. It employs an ``even chance'' training technique to make up for the lack of long-tail chord exposures. The main drawback of this approach is the low segmentation quality, which inevitably lowers the upper-bound of chord recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, it demonstrates a preliminary successfulness of a fully end-to-end approach without post-processing, and also proves the even chance training scheme to be effective for the long-tail classification problem.

Finally, as a preliminary study, a jazz chord estimation system is built from the first framework. Then a chord-scale estimation system is built with a template-based scale tracking algorithm. Some semi-automatic or fully automatic jazz improvisation demos are created out of the combination of the chord-scale tracker, two jazz improvisation musical interfaces, and a Markov model based note generator.
