Firstly, thank my supervisor, Professor Ricky Yu-Kwong Kwok, for his kindly and thoughtful support during my PhD study. The works presented in this thesis, to some degree, are out of my pure personal interest in searching for a crossing point of music and computational technology. They can not even be ever started, if I was not given enough trust and encouragement. Throughout these 4 years time, Professor Kwok and I share a lot of constructive and meaningful ideas and views on the dual mission of research and life, which I believe are beneficial in the rest of my life.

I also thank Professor Francis Chi-moon Lau, for his appreciation of my works. In the first two years, we communicate a lot in terms of music expression interfaces. I am deeply impressed by his enthusiasm and sophisticated knowledge in both computer and music. His review and comments on this thesis really make a lot of difference.

Thank Doctor Xiao Hu and Professor Andrew Horner, two of the best music informatics and computer music researchers, for their insightful reviews and comments on this thesis, which really boost it to another level.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Qing, for her everlasting supportive and positive point of view towards everything I have done. I truly enjoy those fruitful discussions about songwriting, music industry, and jazz. Her passion about music technology always makes me believe that what I have been doing is worthwhile.

I am indeed grateful to be living in the HKU Graduate House, where I gradually improve my spoken English, perfect my accompaniment skills, and learn jazz. My life would have been dry and bored without my house friends. Thank my songwriting partner, the real piano accompanist Jonathan. He plays wonderful gigs, sing-along sessions, and always allows me to watch and learn from his sophisticated techniques. Thank Yi Eun, the real musician, for his sincere appreciation of my music. Thank Kelvin, the real singer, for one of the best vocals in the world. Thank Tianyin, for her small gifts, Faichuns, and cookings. Thank JT, for training me to be better at ``drinking''. There are a lot more people to thank: Billy and Aimie, Ben and Haidi, Chae Yin, Maggie, Haoyuan, Dinghua, Tewei, Lili, Shengda, Pingyu, the card game group, the dancing group, the music group, the list can go on and on... I am just so reluctant to leave and start a new life.

My sincere thanks also go to my labmates in Chow Yei Ching Building 101. Here I met Ho-Cheung, with whom I share a lot of life stories. I met Bony, Dominic, and Sam. They are always willing to help, welcoming to talk, and passionate to share all kinds of ideas. I would also like to thank Xing. He is one of the best colleagues I have in EEE with signal processing and machine learning background. He makes me feel that I am not alone. Finally, I am always grateful to Xiangyu during the teaching assistant time. He is humble, hardworking, strong-minded and he never gives up.

I also thank Yuheng, my best friend in Guangzhou, to always have my back when I am in trouble.

Lastly, I take this opportunity to thank my wife, my parents and my close relatives. They always help when I am in need and they always understand. I am greatly indebted to them, for not being able to be around, and not always doing what they expected. For everything that I have done wrong, I am deeply sorry.
