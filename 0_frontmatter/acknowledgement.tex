First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Ricky Yu-Kwong Kwok, for his kindly and thoughtful support during my PhD study. The works presented in this thesis, to some degree, is out of my pure personal interest in searching for a crossing point of music and computation technology. They can not even be ever started, if I was not given enough trust and encouragement. Throughout these 4 years time, we share a lot of constructive and meaningful ideas on the dual mission of research and life, which I believe are beneficial in the rest of my life.

I also thank Professor Francis Chi-moon Lau, for his appreciation of my works. In the first two years, we communicate a lot in terms of music expression interfaces. I'm deeply impressed by his enthusiasm and knowledge in both computer and music, especially his well mastering of various musical instruments as well as programming languages.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my life-long friend, Cai Qing, for her everlasting supportive and positive point of view towards everything I have done. I really enjoy those fruitful discussions about songwriting, music industry, and jazz. Her passion about music technology always make me believe that what I've been doing is worthwhile.

I am really grateful that I live in the graduate house for most of my PhD time. I gradually improve my spoken English, perfect my music instrumental skills, and learn jazz. My life would have been dry and bored without my graduate house friends. Thank my songwriting partner Jonathan. He plays wonderful gigs, sing-along sessions, and always lets me watch his sophisticated piano keyboard techniques. Thank Yi Eun, the real musician, for his sincere appreciation of my music. Thank Tianyin, for her small gifts, Faichuns, and cookings. Thank JT, for training me to be better at ``drinking''. There are a lot more people to thank: Billy and Aimie, Ben and Haidi, Chae Yin, Maggie, Haoyuan, Lili, the card game group, the dancing group, the music group, the list can go on and on... I am just so reluctant to leave and start a new life.

My sincere thanks also go to my labmates. I work in Chow Yei Ching Building 101, the digital system design lab. Here I met Phillip (Ho-Cheung Ng), with whom I share a lot of life stories. I met Bony (Hung-Kwan Chan), Dominic (Chit-Ho Hung), and Sam Ho. They are always welcoming to talk, and share all kinds of ideas. I would also like to thank Sun Xing. He is one of the best colleagues I have in EEE with signal processing and machine learning background. He makes me feel that I am not alone. Finally, I am always grateful to Xiangyu during the teaching assistant time. He is humble, hardworking, strong-minded and he never gives up.

Last but not least, I take this opportunity to thank my wife and my parents. They always help when I am in need and they always understand. I am greatly indebted to them, for not being able to be around, and not always being what they expected. For everything that I have done wrong, I am deeply sorry.

Thank you for all the memories in these years:
